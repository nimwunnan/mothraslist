things I saw on my lunchtime walk:

* a fat orange cat causing a disturbance among some crows
* an old couple in a combination recumbant/normal bike tandem that let the lady in the recumbant only pedal when she felt like it
* a sign for an open mike night at the Portland Roasting Company's cafe -- kids welcome
